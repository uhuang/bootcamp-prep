    This for loop is tricky to set up!
    Here's the approach: given a source 'Loopy Luna' and a searchValue 'Luna',
    we're going to loop through the source, looking at every substring that's the
    same length as the searchValue:

    Loop
    oopy
    opy
    py L
    ... and so on

    Then we compare each of these substrings to the searchValue. If they match,
    we've found what we're looking for!

    'Luna' is the last substring of length 4 that we could get from the source.
    It doesn't make sense to check any more substrings after Luna, since they would
    would be of length less than 4 (which means they definitely won't match the
    searchValue). That's why our stop condition in the for loop stops the iteration
    before we get to the end of the source string.

    let substring = source.slice(i, i + searchValue.length);

    // if the substring matches the search value...
    if (substring === searchValue) {

      // ...return the current index
      return i;
    }
  }

  // if we get past the end of the for loop, we never found a match and can return -1
  return -1;
}
